# My Personal Portfolio

## Summary
In order to display my work and practice my skills in React, CSS, and Responsive design I built a personal portfolio. Designed with potential employers in mind I wanted to create a space for users to learn more about me, see some of my work I am most proud of, and easily get in contact with me.
